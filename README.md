## Usage

Spin up a REPL and call:

`(-main <STEAM-KEY> <STEAM-USER-ID> n)`

Where STEAM-KEY is a Steam API key you can get ![here](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey), STEAM-USER-ID is your Steam user ID usually found in your profile's URL, and _n_ is the number of game recommendations you'd like to return.

## Recommendation System

The latest version of this program returns _n_ games as identified by matching playtimes between the profiled user and the database of users. Playtimes are matched based on a Poisson distribution constructed in the user profile. If a user in the database's play time falls within the play time distribution of the profiled user then that user and their games (those not shared with the profiled user) are captured.

Games are ranked by playtimes per game per user, so that a user in the database has their own games ranked in popularity in terms of time played. These top games can then be taken and those not shared woth the users who share a similar profile to the profiled user can be ranked in terms of overall time played per game.

Further details on how the model works can be found in the accompanying ![flowchart](docs/flowchart.pdf).

# The Database

It should be noted that the database, which currently is newly built upon each run (for most up to data results), is biased as users are identified from the profiled users friend list and then from those users friends list. Larger sampling may mitigate this to some extent.
